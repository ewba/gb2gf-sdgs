Because energy poverty in Europe is growing over the years is why raising awareness of this problem is crucial.\nThe handbook was set up by Focus, the Society for Sustainable Development together with international partners in the framework of the IDEA Energy Poverty Project (Innovative Direction in Energy Advising). The main goal of the project was to improve existing and develop new educational methods and materials for training adults about energy poverty. You can find them on the project website under the Education tab. The project is an example of good practice and is also recognized by the European Commission.\nThe Focus Society is very dedicated to this topic and is among the most attractive and professional ones in Slovenia – more energy poverty Archives – Focus.

The nature of Maribor island is protected according to local and numerous state regulations (natural monument, natural value of national importance, Natura2000 area, ecologically important area), and the bathing area on the island has been declared a cultural monument. They want to bring the beauty of the island closer to the people of Maribor by spending time actively and having fun in the heart of nature while playing mini golf.\nOn the holiday – Slovenian Sports Day, which is celebrated on 23 September, a mini-golf tournament has been prepared for famous residents of the Municipality of Maribor. With the event on the Slovene Sports Day, they wanted to draw the attention of the public to the importance of spending their free time actively and they donated the tournament prize fund to the Maribor charity for humanitarian purposes.\nThe project is part of the activities of the EPEKA youth centre and is funded by the Youth Office of the Republic of Slovenia and the Municipality of Maribor.",

The event addresses topics such as local, national, and international strategies in the field of tackling climate change and the opportunities we have as individuals to have a positive impact on the environment, although we rarely use them. The event is intended to emphasize the awareness among people about our possibilities to have a positive impact on environmental issues. \nThe project was created as an attractive reflection for young people on where the unbridled impact of man on the environment is leading – to a society where a bathrobe (”bademantl”) will be the only necessary clothing due to global warming. At the last event, with a few Erasmus and other nature advocates, they demonstrated this by sitting in canoes at Koblar Bay and paddling in an activist style – upstream, while at the Island roundtable discussing tackling climate change.\nThe event was accompanied by an expanded educational and cultural program, several participating NGOs, and a strengthened international dimension, which helped to exchange good practices among young people active in the field of environmental protection (the project was implemented in parallel with an international project lasting 7 days and related topics). The project maintains a youthful orientation, which ensures that Bademantl Day is attractive to the basic target group of young people and at the same time high-profile in the media.",

        "desc": "This good practice attempts to manage all parts of the building (which in this case is used for office space) in a sustainable way. This includes temperature control such as installing a thermostat and using it on a timer, turning off radiators at night or when an area is unoccupied; waste management, with as many items as possible recycled and disposed of in as sustainable as possible a manner; and furniture use, with nearly all furniture re-used when a space within the building changes hands.",
        "target": "Institutional level",
        "challenges": "The successful re-use of most furniture items between tenancies, rather than disposing of them is a good success, and key efficiencies also in terms of energy use with things like temperature control.\nThe main challenge and enabling factor is in the planning of these sorts of activities, and regular revision of those plans to suit the needs of the inhabitants of the building. Being able, for example, to tailor the thermostat or turn heat off or on in given rooms can be very useful if properly administered.",
        "lessons": "As above, planning is important.",
